Jiameng Xu is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Ecology at the Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University. Her research focuses on ecosystem-climate interactions, ecosystem modeling, forest management, and ecohydrology. She is a member of the Bioclima Group, where she utilizes process-based ecosystem model such as LPJ-GUESS, integrated with deep learning algorithms, to simulate global terrestrial carbon sinks and quantify environmentally suitable thresholds for vegetation density.
