Sakiba Nabi is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Hydrology and Climate Science at the Tsinghua SIGS. Her expertise lies in hydrology and climate-driven flood extremes, with a research portfolio encompassing spatio-temporal variability of precipitation and temperature, hydrological modeling, Bayesian flood frequency analysis, and the analysis of compound extreme events. Currently, her work focuses on the impacts of extreme weather events on the Asian Water Tower and their influence on regional monsoon dynamics. Additionally, she investigates the effects of climate-induced floods and droughts on agricultural productivity, aiming to understand the broader implications of a changing climate on water resources and food security.
