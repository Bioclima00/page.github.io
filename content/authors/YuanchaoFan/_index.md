bio: My research interests lie in the field of climate change impact and climate mitigation. Focusing on issues in the Climate-Land-Ecosystem-Society nexus, I take an interdisciplinary approach to assessing the impact of climate change and climate intervention (including solar geoengineering) on agriculture, ecosystem, and human livability, as well as the feedback of land cover change to climate, to provide decision support for addressing climate change and building a carbon neutral society.

Dr. Yuanchao Fan joined Tsinghua SIGS in January 2023, after spending nearly 14 years in the USA and Europe. He specializes in climate change impact assessment and mitigation, applying principles of ecological climatology. His representative works include: 1. developing a human energy balance model to project the impact of extreme heat stress on human health, 2. evaluating the impacts of solar geoengineering and emissions reduction scenarios on agriculture using Earth system models, and 3. developing a CLM-Palm model to quantify the impact of rainforest to oil palm conversion on land-atmosphere carbon, water, and energy fluxes.
