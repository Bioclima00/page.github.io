abstract: Abstract By mediating evapotranspiration processes, plant canopies play
  an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and regional climate. Substantial
  uncertainties exist in modeling canopy water interception and related hydrological
  processes due to rainfall forcing frequency selection and varying canopy traits.
  Here we design a new time interpolation method “zero” to better represent convective‐type
  precipitation in tropical regions. We also implement and recalibrate plant functional
  type‐specific interception parameters for rainforests and oil palm plantations,
  where oil palms express higher water interception capacity than forests, using the
  Community Land Model (CLM) versions 4.5 and 5.0 with CLM‐Palm embedded. Reconciling
  the interception scheme with realistic precipitation forcing produces more accurate
  canopy evaporation and transpiration for both plant functional types, which in turn
  improves simulated evapotranspiration and energy partitioning when benchmarked against
  observations from our study sites in Indonesia and an extensive literature review.
  Regional simulations for Sumatra and Kalimantan show that industrial oil palm plantations
  have 18–27% higher transpiration and 15–20% higher evapotranspiration than forests
  on an annual regional average basis across different ages or successional stages,
  even though the forests experience higher average precipitation according to reanalysis
  data. Our land‐only modeling results indicate that current oil palm plantations
  in Sumatra and Kalimantan use 15–20% more water (mean 220 mm or 20 Gt) per year
  compared to lowland rainforests of the same extent. The extra water use by oil palm
  reduces soil moisture and runoff that could affect ecosystem services such as productivity
  of staple crops and availability of drinking water in rural areas. ,  Plain Language
  Summary This manuscript addresses two issues in modeling canopy rainfall interception
  and associated water cycle processes in the Community Land Model and applies the
  model development to simulate a rainforest to oil palm transformation system. First,
  interpolating precipitation data from a coarser input frequency (e.g., three‐hourly
  or six‐hourly) to a finer model timescale (half‐hourly) with a nearest time method
  would introduce unrealistic rain events and bias the water cycle simulation for
  regions with convective‐type (short and intense) precipitation. Second, different
  canopy structures and leaf and stem morphologies, such as those of oil palm and
  rainforest, offer different water interception capacities, which questions the validity
  of a uniform interception parameterization across plant types used in land surface
  models. We design a new time interpolation method and implement plant type‐specific
  interception parameters in the Community Land Model, which produce more realistic
  precipitation events for tropical climate and predict more accurate canopy evaporation
  and transpiration for both oil palm and forest compared to observation. Results
  from our improved modeling approach indicate that current industrial oil palm plantations
  in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) increase water use and reduce soil moisture
  and surface and subsurface runoffs, which could affect ecosystem services that rely
  on soil water reserve and river discharge. ,  Key Points    We design a new time
  interpolation method “zero” to better represent convective‐type precipitation in
  tropical regions   Using PFT‐specific interception parameters improves simulated
  partitioning of evapotranspiration for both oil palm and forest   Current oil palm
  plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan use 15–20% more water (211–238 mm) per year
  compared to lowland rainforests
