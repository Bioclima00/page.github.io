abstract: 'Abstract. The nitrogen cycle and its effect on carbon uptake in the terrestrial
  biosphere is a recent progression in earth system models. As with any new component
  of a model, it is important to understand the behaviour, strengths, and limitations
  of the various process representations. Here we assess and compare five land surface
  models with nitrogen cycles that are used as the terrestrial components of some
  of the earth system models in CMIP6. The land surface models were run offline with
  a common spin-up and forcing protocol. We use a historical control simulation and
  two perturbations to assess the model nitrogen-related performances: a simulation
  with atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 200 ppm and one with nitrogen deposition
  increased by 50 kgN ha−1 yr−1. There is generally greater variability in productivity
  response between models to increased nitrogen than to carbon dioxide. Across the
  five models the response to carbon dioxide globally was 5 % to 20 % and the response
  to nitrogen was 2 % to 24 %. The models are not evenly distributed within the ensemble
  range, with two of the models having low productivity response to nitrogen and another
  one with low response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, compared to the other
  models. In all five models individual grid cells tend to exhibit bimodality, with
  either a strong response to increased nitrogen or atmospheric carbon dioxide but
  rarely to both to an equal extent. However, this local effect does not scale to
  either the regional or global level. The global and tropical responses are generally
  more accurately modelled than boreal, tundra, or other high-latitude areas compared
  to observations. These results are due to divergent choices in the representation
  of key nitrogen cycle processes. They show the need for more observational studies
  to enhance understanding of nitrogen cycle processes, especially nitrogen-use efficiency
  and biological nitrogen fixation.'
