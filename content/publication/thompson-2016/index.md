abstract: 'Anticipating landscape-­to regional-­scale impacts of land use on ecosystems
  and the services they provide is a central challenge for scientists, policymakers,
  and resource managers. Working with a panel of practitioners and regional experts,
  we developed and analyzed four plausible but divergent ­land-­use scenarios that
  depict the future of Massachusetts from 2010 to 2060 to address two questions: (1)
  “How do the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem service provisioning
  vary under the ­different land-­use regimes?” and (2) “What are the synergies and
  trade-­offs among direct human uses, ecosystem services, and habitat quality?” Each
  scenario specifies the detailed prescriptions for the major uses of the forests,
  including conversion to residential and commercial development, clearing new farmland,
  shifting silvicultural practices, and designating forests protected from development.
  We simulated the land-u­ se scenarios and their interactions with anticipated climate
  change by coupling statistical models of land use to the LANDIS-I­I landscape model
  and then evaluated the outcomes in terms of the magnitude and spatial distribution
  of (1) direct human uses of the landscape (residential and commercial development,
  agricultural, timber harvest), (2) ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood regulation,
  nutrient retention), and (3) habitat quality (forest tree species composition, interior
  forest habitat). Across all scenarios, conflicts occurred between dispersed residential
  development and the supply of ecosystem services and habitat quality. In all but
  the scenario that envisioned a significant agricultural expansion, forest growth
  resulted in net increases in aboveground carbon storage, despite the concomitant
  forest clearing and harvesting. One scenario, called Forests as Infrastructure,
  showed the potential for synergies between increased forest harvest volume through
  the sustainable practices that encouraged the maintenance of economically and ecologically
  important tree species, and carbon storage. This scenario also showed trade-o­ ffs
  between development density and water quantity and quality at the watershed scale.
  The process of integrated scenario analysis led to important insights for land managers
  and policymakers in a populated forested region where there are tensions among development,
  forest harvesting, and land conservation. More broadly, the results emphasize the
  need to consider the consequences of contrasting land-­use regimes that result from
  the interactions between human decisions and spatially heterogeneous landscape dynamics.'
