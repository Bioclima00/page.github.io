abstract: The Norwegian Climate Prediction Model version 1 (NorCPM1) is a new research
  tool for performing climate reanalyses and seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions.
  It combines the Norwegian Earth System Model version 1 (NorESM1) – which features
  interactive aerosol–cloud schemes and an isopycnic-coordinate ocean component with
  biogeochemistry – with anomaly assimilation of sea surface temperature (SST) and
  T /S-proﬁle observations using the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF).
