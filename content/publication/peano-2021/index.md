abstract: Abstract. Plant phenology plays a fundamental role in land–atmosphere interactions,
  and its variability and variations are an indicator of climate and environmental
  changes. For this reason, current land surface models include phenology parameterizations
  and related biophysical and biogeochemical processes. In this work, the climatology
  of the beginning and end of the growing season, simulated by the land component
  of seven state-of-the-art European Earth system models participating in the CMIP6,
  is evaluated globally against satellite observations. The assessment is performed
  using the vegetation metric leaf area index and a recently developed approach, named
  four growing season types. On average, the land surface models show a 0.6-month
  delay in the growing season start, while they are about 0.5 months earlier in the
  growing season end. The difference with observation tends to be higher in the Southern
  Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere. High agreement between land surface
  models and observations is exhibited in areas dominated by broadleaf deciduous trees,
  while high variability is noted in regions dominated by broadleaf deciduous shrubs.
  Generally, the timing of the growing season end is accurately simulated in about
  25 % of global land grid points versus 16 % in the timing of growing season start.
  The refinement of phenology parameterization can lead to better representation of
  vegetation-related energy, water, and carbon cycles in land surface models, but
  plant phenology is also affected by plant physiology and soil hydrology processes.
  Consequently, phenology representation and, in general, vegetation modelling is
  a complex task, which still needs further improvement, evaluation, and multi-model
  comparison.
