abstract: The evaporation of intercepted precipitation (Ei) is an important component
  of evapotranspiration. Investigating the spatial and temporal variations of Ei and
  its driving factors can improve our understanding of water and energy balance in
  the context of China’s greening. This study investigated the spatial and temporal
  variation of Ei across China during 2001−2020 using PML ET product with a temporal
  resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m. The results showed that
  Ei generally decreased from southeast to northwest, which was contributed by the
  coupled effect of precipitation and vegetation coverage variation across China.
  Generally, Ei showed an increasing trend over the last two decades with an average
  changing rate of 0.45 mm/year. The changing rate varied greatly among different
  regions, with the most obvious change occurring in tropical and humid regions. Precipitation
  was the most important climatic factor driving the interannual change of Ei over
  the past two decades, with an average contribution rate of 30.18~37.59%. Relative
  humidity was the second most important climatic factor following precipitation.
  Temperature showed contracting contribution in different thermal regions. The contribution
  rates of NDVI and LAI followed a similar spatial pattern. Both the contribution
  rates of NDVI and LAI generally increased along the moisture gradient from east
  to west and generally increased from south to north.
