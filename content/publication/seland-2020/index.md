abstract: The second version of the coupled Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2)
  is presented and evaluated. NorESM2 is based on the second version of the Community
  Earth System Model (CESM2) and shares with CESM2 the computer code infrastructure
  and many Earth system model components. However, NorESM2 employs entirely different
  ocean and ocean biogeochemistry models. The atmosphere component of NorESM2 (CAM-Nor)
  includes a different module for aerosol physics and chemistry, including interactions
  with cloud and radiation; additionally, CAMNor includes improvements in the formulation
  of local dry and moist energy conservation, in local and global angular momentum
  conservation, and in the computations for deep convection and air–sea ﬂuxes. The
  surface components of NorESM2 have minor changes in the albedo calculations and
  to land and sea-ice models.
