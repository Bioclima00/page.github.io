abstract: Rubber plantations are an economically viable land-use type that occupies
  large swathes of land in Southeast Asia that have undergone conversion from native
  forest to intensive plantation forestry. Such land-use change has a strong impact
  on carbon, energy, and water fluxes in ecosystems, and uncertainties exist in the
  modeling of future land-use change impacts on these fluxes due to the scarcity of
  measured data and poor representation of key biogeochemical processes. In this current
  modeling effort, we utilized the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5) to simulate
  a rubber plant functional type (PFT) by comparing the baseline parameter values
  of tropical evergreen PFT and tropical deciduous PFT with a newly developed rubber
  PFT (focused on the parameterization and modification of phenology and allocation
  processes) based on site-level observations of a rubber clone in Indonesia. We found
  that the baseline tropical evergreen and baseline tropical deciduous functions and
  parameterizations in CLM5 poorly simulate the leaf area index, carbon dynamics,
  and water fluxes of rubber plantations. The newly developed rubber PFT and parametrizations
  (CLM-rubber) showed that daylength could be used as a universal trigger for defoliation
  and refoliation of rubber plantations. CLM-rubber was able to predict seasonal patterns
  of latex yield reasonably well, despite highly variable tapping periods across Southeast
  Asia. Further, model comparisons indicated that CLM-rubber can simulate carbon and
  energy fluxes similar to the existing rubber model simulations available in the
  literature. Our modeling results indicate that CLM-rubber can be applied in Southeast
  Asia to examine variations in carbon and water fluxes for rubber plantations and
  assess how rubber-related land-use changes in the tropics feedback to climate through
  carbon and water cycling.
