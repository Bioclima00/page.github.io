abstract: 'Canopy shadowing mediated by topography is an important source of radiometric
  distortion on remote sensing images of rugged terrain. Topographic correction based
  on the sun–canopy–sensor (SCS) model signiﬁcantly improved over those based on the
  sun–terrain–sensor (STS) model for surfaces with high forest canopy cover, because
  the SCS model considers and preserves the geotropic nature of trees. The SCS model
  accounts for sub-pixel canopy shadowing effects and normalizes the sunlit canopy
  area within a pixel. However, it does not account for mutual shadowing between neighboring
  pixels. Pixel-to-pixel shadowing is especially apparent for ﬁne resolution satellite
  images in which individual tree crowns are resolved. This paper proposes a new topographic
  correction model: the sun–crown–sensor (SCnS) model based on high-resolution satellite
  imagery (IKONOS) and high-precision LiDAR digital elevation model. An improvement
  on the C-correction logic with a radiance partitioning method to address the effects
  of diffuse irradiance is also introduced (SCnS + C). In addition, we incorporate
  a weighting variable, based on pixel shadow fraction, on the direct and diffuse
  radiance portions to enhance the retrieval of at-sensor radiance and reﬂectance
  of highly shadowed tree pixels and form another variety of SCnS model (SCnS + W).
  Model evaluation with IKONOS test data showed that the new SCnS model outperformed
  the STS and SCS models in quantifying the correlation between terrain-regulated
  illumination factor and at-sensor radiance. Our adapted C-correction logic based
  on the sun–crown–sensor geometry and radiance partitioning better represented the
  general additive effects of diffuse radiation than C parameters derived from the
  STS or SCS models. The weighting factor Wt also signiﬁcantly enhanced correction
  results by reducing within-class standard deviation and balancing the mean pixel
  radiance between sunlit and shaded slopes. We analyzed these improvements with model
  comparison on the red and near infrared bands. The advantages of SCnS + C and SCnS
  + W on both bands are expected to facilitate forest classiﬁcation and change detection
  applications.'
