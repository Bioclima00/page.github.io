abstract: Forest mortality along highways has long been a concern in areas where de-icing
  compounds are applied during winter. This study combined the spatial advantage of
  high-resolution remote sensing imagery and the temporal advantage of long-term archival
  imagery to quantify forest mortality and to detect the subtle and chronic effects
  of road de-icing salts for a large mountain watershed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
  USA. IKONOS-derived mortality was used in a ﬁne-scale spatial analysis to assess
  road proximity and roadside topography effects on forest mortality and to compare
  two potential mechanisms of de-icing salt damage, i.e. aerial deposition and soil
  uptake. These mechanisms were modeled using spatial proxy variables that were constructed
  from LiDAR topographical data. The analysis revealed a clear trend of increasing
  mortality with increasing potential for aerial deposition of de-icing salt onto
  tree crowns, mainly occurring within 10 m from roads. The effect of soil uptake
  of salt was weaker than that of aerial deposition but had a broader potential effect
  zone that extended to at least 100 m from roads. Landsat TM-derived mortality from
  1989 to 2010 provided a long-term time series that indicated both immediate and
  lagged effects of salt application on forest mortality. Immediate effects of de-icing
  salt were only distinct in wet years when salt application and spray generation
  by passing trafﬁc and snow plowing were likely high and other damaging factors,
  such as bark beetles or drought mortality, were likely weak. A strong and consistent
  one-year lag in the effect of salt application on incidence of mortality suggested
  that longer-term impacts of de-icing salt on forest health likely involved more
  complex pathways than simply aerial deposition. Our multi-scale remote sensing approach
  provided convincing evidence that de-icing salt was a signiﬁcant factor for roadside
  forest mortality and allows for efﬁcient future monitoring at the large-watershed
  scale.
