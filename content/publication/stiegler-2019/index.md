abstract: Abstract. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2015 was one of the
  strongest observed in almost 20 years and set the stage for a severe drought and
  the emergence of widespread fires and related smoke emission over large parts of
  Southeast Asia. In the tropical lowlands of Sumatra, which were heavily affected
  by the drought and haze, large areas of tropical rainforest have been converted
  into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantations during the past decades. In
  this study, we investigate the impact of drought and smoke haze on the net ecosystem
  CO2 exchange, evapotranspiration, yield and surface energy budget in a commercial
  oil palm plantation in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia) by using micrometeorological
  measurements, the eddy covariance method, yield data and a multiple linear regression
  model (MLRM). With the MLRM we identify the contribution of meteorological and environmental
  parameters to the net ecosystem CO2 exchange. During the initial part of the drought,
  when incoming shortwave radiation was elevated, net CO2 uptake increased by 50 %
  despite a decrease in upper-layer soil moisture by 35 %, an increase in air temperature
  by 10 % and a tripling of atmospheric vapour pressure deficit. Emerging smoke haze
  decreased incoming solar radiation by 35 % compared to non-drought conditions and
  diffuse radiation almost became the sole shortwave radiation flux for 2 months,
  resulting in a strong decrease in net CO2 uptake by 86 %. Haze conditions resulted
  in a complete pause of oil palm net carbon accumulation for about 1.5 months and
  contributed to a decline in oil palm yield by 35 %. With respect to a projected
  pronounced drying trend over the western Pacific during a future El Niño, our model
  showed that an increase in drought may stimulate net CO2 uptake, while more severe
  smoke haze, in combination with drought, can lead to pronounced losses in productivity
  and net CO2 uptake, highlighting the importance of fire prevention.
