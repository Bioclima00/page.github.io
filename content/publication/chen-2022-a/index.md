abstract: Increasing numbers of observations and research studies have detected widespread
  vegetation greening across China since the 1980s. The dynamics of vegetation can
  inﬂuence the process of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) and its components (vegetation
  transpiration (Ec), soil evaporation (Es), and intercepted precipitation evaporation
  (Ei)). However, it is still not clear how the ET components responded to China’s
  greening. This work investigated the characteristics and dynamics of ET components
  for different climate zones and moisture regions and the dominant ecosystems over
  China using PML ET products during 2001–2020. The results showed that ET increased
  by 9%, Ec and Ec/ET increased by 18.7% and 4.4%, respectively, contributing to more
  than 90% of the ET increment across China. The increment in Ec generally increased
  from north to south with the most obvious change of Ec/ET having occurred in the
  temperate zone and semi-humid regions. Es increased in arid, semi-arid and plateau
  climate regions but decreased in the remaining climate zones. As a result, Es only
  decreased by 2.7% on average, while Es/ET decreased by 5.7%. Ei increased by 26.6%
  across China, while Ei/ET changed slightly due to the little contribution of Ei
  to ET. The agricultural ecosystem presented the most obvious change of Ec and Es
  among the dominant ecosystems, and the most obvious change of Ei occurred in the
  forest ecosystem. Vegetation greening altered biophysical factors that govern heat
  and vapor exchange in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, thus modulating the reallocation
  of ET components.
