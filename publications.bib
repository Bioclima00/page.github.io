	abstract = {Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe) is a key metric of the coupled carbon and water cycles. Understanding WUEe variations along the climate gradient (arid to humid) and across different vegetation ecosystems is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate variability on these ecosystems. Based on the Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) dataset from a coupled diagnostic biophysical model, this study investigated the spatio­ temporal variations and driving factors of WUEe under different aridity conditions and across vegetation types in China from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that the annual mean WUEe was 1.36 ± 0.07 g C kg− 1 H2O in China, and humid regions had higher WUEe than other arid regions except for the extremely arid regions (the top level of aridity classification). Annual WUEe showed an increasing trend of 0.084 g C kg− 1 H2O/10a in China, which mainly occurred in humid areas. The forest ecosystem had the highest WUEe (2.48 g C kg− 1 H2O), fol­ lowed by shrubland (2.11 g C kg− 1 H2O) and cropland (1.99 g C kg− 1 H2O) ecosystems. Leaf Area Index (LAI) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed the most to increases in WUEe, which accounted for areal proportions of 63.82\% and 77.36\% of China, and average relative contributions of 31.80\% and 14.73\%, respectively. In contrast, air temperature (TEM) contributed the most to WUEe decreases, with an areal proportion of 61.73\% and an average relative contribution of 12.42\%. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation (PRE) and downward short-wave radiation (SSRD) showed little differences in the proportions of land area where they either promoted and suppressed WUEe and their respective relative contributions were 16.99\%, 14.32\% and 8.61\%.},

The dynamics of vegetation can inﬂuence the process of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) and its components (vegetation transpiration (Ec), soil evaporation (Es), and intercepted precipitation evaporation (Ei)). However, it is still not clear how the ET components responded to China’s greening. This work investigated the characteristics and dynamics of ET components for different climate zones and moisture regions and the dominant ecosystems over China using PML ET products during 2001–2020. The results showed that ET increased by 9\%, Ec and Ec/ET increased by 18.7\% and 4.4\%, respectively, contributing to more than 90\% of the ET increment across China. The increment in Ec generally increased from north to south with the most obvious change of Ec/ET having occurred in the temperate zone and semi-humid regions. Es increased in arid, semi-arid and plateau climate regions but decreased in the remaining climate zones. As a result, Es only decreased by 2.7\% on average, while Es/ET decreased by 5.7\%. Ei increased by 26.6\% across China, while Ei/ET changed slightly due to the little contribution of Ei to ET. The agricultural ecosystem presented the most obvious change of Ec and Es among the dominant ecosystems, and the most obvious change of Ei occurred in the forest ecosystem. Vegetation greening altered biophysical factors that govern heat and vapor exchange in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, thus modulating the reallocation of ET components.},

This study investigated the spatial and temporal variation of Ei across China during 2001−2020 using PML ET product with a temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m. The results showed that Ei generally decreased from southeast to northwest, which was contributed by the coupled effect of precipitation and vegetation coverage variation across China. Generally, Ei showed an increasing trend over the last two decades with an average changing rate of 0.45 mm/year. The changing rate varied greatly among different regions, with the most obvious change occurring in tropical and humid regions. Precipitation was the most important climatic factor driving the interannual change of Ei over the past two decades, with an average contribution rate of 30.18{\textasciitilde}37.59\%. Relative humidity was the second most important climatic factor following precipitation. Temperature showed contracting contribution in different thermal regions. The contribution rates of NDVI and LAI followed a similar spatial pattern. Both the contribution rates of NDVI and LAI generally increased along the moisture gradient from east to west and generally increased from south to north.},

	abstract = {Rubber plantations are an economically viable land-use type that occupies large swathes of land in Southeast Asia that have undergone conversion from native forest to intensive plantation forestry. Such land-use change has a strong impact on carbon, energy, and water fluxes in ecosystems, and uncertainties exist in the modeling of future land-use change impacts on these fluxes due to the scarcity of measured data and poor representation of key biogeochemical processes. In this current modeling effort, we utilized the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5) to simulate a rubber plant functional type (PFT) by comparing the baseline parameter values of tropical evergreen PFT and tropical deciduous PFT with a newly developed rubber PFT (focused on the parameterization and modification of phenology and allocation processes) based on site-level observations of a rubber clone in Indonesia. We found that the baseline tropical evergreen and baseline tropical deciduous functions and parameterizations in CLM5 poorly simulate the leaf area index, carbon dynamics, and water fluxes of rubber plantations. The newly developed rubber PFT and parametrizations (CLM-rubber) showed that daylength could be used as a universal trigger for defoliation and refoliation of rubber plantations. CLM-rubber was able to predict seasonal patterns of latex yield reasonably well, despite highly variable tapping periods across Southeast Asia. Further, model comparisons indicated that CLM-rubber can simulate carbon and energy fluxes similar to the existing rubber model simulations available in the literature. Our modeling results indicate that CLM-rubber can be applied in Southeast Asia to examine variations in carbon and water fluxes for rubber plantations and assess how rubber-related land-use changes in the tropics feedback to climate through carbon and water cycling.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Plant phenology plays a fundamental role in land–atmosphere interactions, and its variability and variations are an indicator of climate and environmental changes.
For this reason, current land surface models include
phenology parameterizations and related biophysical and biogeochemical processes.
In this work, the climatology of the beginning and end of the growing season, simulated by the land component of seven state-of-the-art European Earth system models participating in the CMIP6, is evaluated globally against satellite observations. The assessment is performed using the vegetation metric leaf area index and a recently developed approach, named four growing season types.
On average, the land surface models show a 0.6-month delay in the growing season start, while they are about 0.5 months earlier in the growing season end. The difference with observation tends to be higher in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere.
High agreement between land surface models and observations is exhibited in areas dominated by broadleaf deciduous trees, while high variability is noted in regions dominated by broadleaf deciduous shrubs.
Generally, the timing of the growing season end is accurately simulated in about 25 \% of global land grid points versus 16 \% in the timing of growing season start.
The refinement of phenology parameterization can lead to better representation of vegetation-related energy, water, and carbon cycles in land surface models, but plant phenology
is also affected by plant physiology and soil hydrology processes.
Consequently, phenology representation and, in general, vegetation
modelling is a complex task, which still needs further improvement, evaluation, and multi-model comparison.},

	abstract = {Methane emissions from natural wetlands tend to increase with temperature and therefore may lead to a positive feedback under future climate change. However, their temperature response includes confounding factors and appears to differ on different time scales. Observed methane emissions depend strongly on temperature on a seasonal basis, but if the annual mean emissions are compared between sites, there is only a small temperature effect. We hypothesize that microbial dynamics are a major driver of the seasonal cycle and that they can explain this apparent discrepancy. We introduce a relatively simple model of methanogenic growth and dormancy into a wetland methane scheme that is used in an Earth system model. We show that this addition is sufficient to reproduce the observed seasonal dynamics of methane emissions in fully saturated wetland sites, at the same time as reproducing the annual mean emissions. We find that a more complex scheme used in recent Earth system models does not add predictive power. The sites used span a range of climatic conditions, with the majority in high latitudes. The difference in apparent temperature sensitivity seasonally versus spatially cannot be recreated by the non‐microbial schemes tested. We therefore conclude that microbial dynamics are a strong candidate to be driving the seasonal cycle of wetland methane emissions. We quantify longer‐term temperature sensitivity using this scheme and show that it gives approximately a 12\% increase in emissions per degree of warming globally. This is in addition to any hydrological changes, which could also impact future methane emissions.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Wet soils such as bogs, fens, and other wetlands emit methane gas. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that adds to climate warming. It is important to understand its net production and also how this might change as the Earth warms. Generally, scientists have found that warmer soils emit more methane. However, there is a discrepancy between comparing warm versus cold sites—where the effect of the temperature difference is relatively small—and comparing warmer and colder seasons of the year, where the effect of temperature is much stronger. Since methane emissions are caused by microbes, we investigated whether their behavior might provide an explanation for this discrepancy. We carefully constructed a computer model to simulate the microbes and found that the model could indeed explain the apparent discrepancy in the seasonal and location effects of temperature that was measured. We found that two global climate models did not recreate these seasonal and location effects of temperature until we included the behavior of the soil microbes. Using our new global microbial model, we estimate that there will be around 12\% extra methane emission from global wetlands for each degree of global warming, assuming other factors do not change.

terrestrial biosphere is a recent progression in earth system models. As
with any new component of a model, it is important to understand the
behaviour, strengths, and limitations of the various process
representations. Here we assess and compare five land surface models with
nitrogen cycles that are used as the terrestrial components of some of the
earth system models in CMIP6. The land surface models were run offline with
a common spin-up and forcing protocol. We use a historical control
simulation and two perturbations to assess the model nitrogen-related
performances: a simulation with atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 200 ppm and one with nitrogen deposition increased by 50 kgN ha−1 yr−1. There is generally greater variability in productivity response
between models to increased nitrogen than to carbon dioxide. Across the five
models the response to carbon dioxide globally was 5 \% to 20 \% and the
response to nitrogen was 2 \% to 24 \%. The models are not evenly distributed
within the ensemble range, with two of the models having low productivity
response to nitrogen and another one with low response to elevated atmospheric
carbon dioxide, compared to the other models. In all five models individual
grid cells tend to exhibit bimodality, with either a strong response to
increased nitrogen or atmospheric carbon dioxide but rarely to both to an
equal extent. However, this local effect does not scale to either the
regional or global level. The global and tropical responses are generally
more accurately modelled than boreal, tundra, or other high-latitude areas
compared to observations. These results are due to divergent choices in the
representation of key nitrogen cycle processes. They show the need for more
observational studies to enhance understanding of nitrogen cycle processes,
especially nitrogen-use efficiency and biological nitrogen fixation.},

	abstract = {Climate geoengineering has the potential to reduce global warming. However, the nonlinear responses of Earth's large‐scale circulation to climate geoengineering can exacerbate regional climate change, with potential inequality risks. We show noticeable inequality in the responses of drylands when three radiative forcing geoengineering (RFG) methodologies—cirrus cloud thinning (CCT), marine sky brightening (MSB), and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)—individually reduce the radiative forcing of the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario using a set of the Norwegian Earth system model (NorESM1‐ME) experiments. In North America, CCT and SAI alleviate drylands expansion, whereas drylands expand further under MSB. CCT induces signiﬁcantly wetter conditions over the western Sahel. Wetting over Australia is enhanced and prevented by MSB and SAI, respectively. Our results suggest spatially inequal distributions of beneﬁts and harms of individual RFGs on the projected distribution of drylands, which should be considered before any real‐world application of such RFGs. Plain Language Summary Climate geoengineering has the potential to reduce global warming levels signiﬁcantly, according to modeling experiments. However, regional impacts of individual climate geoengineering methods are inequal, raising concerns about fairness of negative side effects of such methods. Here, impacts of climate geoengineering on the global distribution of drylands are projected using an Earth system model, NorESM1‐ME. Three geoengineering methods are adopted: cirrus cloud thinning (CCT), marine sky brightening (MSB), and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). All methods commonly reduce about 2 °C of global warming in the late 21st century relative to the high CO2 emission scenario, representative concentration pathway 8.5. Drylands respond differently to individual methods, especially in North America, the western Sahel, and Australia. In North America, CCT and SAI alleviate drylands expansion, whereas the expansion of drylands is intensiﬁed under MSB. CCT notably reduces drylands expansion over the western Sahel. The reduction of drylands in Australia is enhanced by MSB due to atmospheric circulation changes but prevented by SAI. Our results suggest that climate geoengineering can exacerbate drylands expansion in some regions despite potential alleviation in other regions. Such inequalities should be considered if RFGs for real‐world applications to mitigate global warming were ever to be considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2015 was one of the strongest observed in almost 20 years and set the stage for a severe drought and the emergence of widespread fires and related smoke emission over large parts of Southeast Asia. In the tropical lowlands of Sumatra, which were heavily affected by the drought and haze, large areas of tropical rainforest have been converted into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantations during the past decades. In this study, we investigate the impact of drought and smoke haze on the net ecosystem CO2 exchange, evapotranspiration, yield and surface energy budget in a commercial oil palm plantation in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia) by using micrometeorological measurements, the eddy covariance method, yield data and a multiple linear regression model (MLRM). With the MLRM we identify the contribution of meteorological and environmental parameters to the net ecosystem CO2 exchange. During the initial part of the drought, when incoming shortwave radiation was elevated, net CO2 uptake increased by 50 \% despite a decrease in upper-layer soil moisture by 35 \%, an increase in air temperature by 10 \% and a tripling of atmospheric vapour pressure deficit. Emerging smoke haze decreased incoming solar radiation by 35 \% compared to non-drought conditions and diffuse radiation almost became the sole shortwave radiation flux for 2 months, resulting in a strong decrease in net CO2 uptake by 86 \%. Haze conditions resulted in a complete pause of oil palm net carbon accumulation for about 1.5 months and contributed to a decline in oil palm yield by 35 \%. With respect to a projected pronounced drying trend over the western Pacific during a future El Niño, our model showed that an increase in drought may stimulate net CO2 uptake, while more severe smoke haze, in combination with drought, can lead to pronounced losses in productivity and net CO2 uptake, highlighting the importance of fire prevention.},

            By mediating evapotranspiration processes, plant canopies play an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and regional climate. Substantial uncertainties exist in modeling canopy water interception and related hydrological processes due to rainfall forcing frequency selection and varying canopy traits. Here we design a new time interpolation method “zero” to better represent convective‐type precipitation in tropical regions. We also implement and recalibrate plant functional type‐specific interception parameters for rainforests and oil palm plantations, where oil palms express higher water interception capacity than forests, using the Community Land Model (CLM) versions 4.5 and 5.0 with CLM‐Palm embedded. Reconciling the interception scheme with realistic precipitation forcing produces more accurate canopy evaporation and transpiration for both plant functional types, which in turn improves simulated evapotranspiration and energy partitioning when benchmarked against observations from our study sites in Indonesia and an extensive literature review. Regional simulations for Sumatra and Kalimantan show that industrial oil palm plantations have 18–27\% higher transpiration and 15–20\% higher evapotranspiration than forests on an annual regional average basis across different ages or successional stages, even though the forests experience higher average precipitation according to reanalysis data. Our land‐only modeling results indicate that current oil palm plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan use 15–20\% more water (mean 220 mm or 20 Gt) per year compared to lowland rainforests of the same extent. The extra water use by oil palm reduces soil moisture and runoff that could affect ecosystem services such as productivity of staple crops and availability of drinking water in rural areas.

            Plain Language Summary
            This manuscript addresses two issues in modeling canopy rainfall interception and associated water cycle processes in the Community Land Model and applies the model development to simulate a rainforest to oil palm transformation system. First, interpolating precipitation data from a coarser input frequency (e.g., three‐hourly or six‐hourly) to a finer model timescale (half‐hourly) with a nearest time method would introduce unrealistic rain events and bias the water cycle simulation for regions with convective‐type (short and intense) precipitation. Second, different canopy structures and leaf and stem morphologies, such as those of oil palm and rainforest, offer different water interception capacities, which questions the validity of a uniform interception parameterization across plant types used in land surface models. We design a new time interpolation method and implement plant type‐specific interception parameters in the Community Land Model, which produce more realistic precipitation events for tropical climate and predict more accurate canopy evaporation and transpiration for both oil palm and forest compared to observation. Results from our improved modeling approach indicate that current industrial oil palm plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) increase water use and reduce soil moisture and surface and subsurface runoffs, which could affect ecosystem services that rely on soil water reserve and river discharge.

	abstract = {Anticipating landscape-­to regional-­scale impacts of land use on ecosystems and the services they provide is a central challenge for scientists, policymakers, and resource managers. Working with a panel of practitioners and regional experts, we developed and analyzed four plausible but divergent ­land-­use scenarios that depict the future of Massachusetts from 2010 to 2060 to address two questions: (1) “How do the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem service provisioning vary under the ­different land-­use regimes?” and (2) “What are the synergies and trade-­offs among direct human uses, ecosystem services, and habitat quality?” Each scenario specifies the detailed prescriptions for the major uses of the forests, including conversion to residential and commercial development, clearing new farmland, shifting silvicultural practices, and designating forests protected from development. We simulated the land-u­ se scenarios and their interactions with anticipated climate change by coupling statistical models of land use to the LANDIS-I­I landscape model and then evaluated the outcomes in terms of the magnitude and spatial distribution of (1) direct human uses of the landscape (residential and commercial development, agricultural, timber harvest), (2) ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood regulation, nutrient retention), and (3) habitat quality (forest tree species composition, interior forest habitat). Across all scenarios, conflicts occurred between dispersed residential development and the supply of ecosystem services and habitat quality. In all but the scenario that envisioned a significant agricultural expansion, forest growth resulted in net increases in aboveground carbon storage, despite the concomitant forest clearing and harvesting. One scenario, called Forests as Infrastructure, showed the potential for synergies between increased forest harvest volume through the sustainable practices that encouraged the maintenance of economically and ecologically important tree species, and carbon storage. This scenario also showed trade-o­ ffs between development density and water quantity and quality at the watershed scale. The process of integrated scenario analysis led to important insights for land managers and policymakers in a populated forested region where there are tensions among development, forest harvesting, and land conservation. More broadly, the results emphasize the need to consider the consequences of contrasting land-­use regimes that result from the interactions between human decisions and spatially heterogeneous landscape dynamics.},

	abstract = {In forests of the western United States, high levels of forest stocking attributed to ﬁre exclusion and settlement-era logging practices have coincided with periods of extensive forest mortality associated with extreme drought and forest pest outbreaks. This has led to the widespread but largely untested generalization that increased stand density causes increased levels of forest mortality, even for uneven-aged, multi-species, mature stands that are not actively undergoing self-thinning. We used archival Landsat imagery to examine: (1) variations in forest mortality among forest types and climate periods from 1985 to 2010 in the mixed conifer forest of the Lake Tahoe Basin, (2) relationships between stand density and mortality in the subsequent year, and (3) the inﬂuence of environmental variables on forest mortality. We found that positive density dependent mortality, where increased stand density is associated with increased probability of mortality, is associated more with lower elevation forests and drier climate periods. In mid- to upper-elevation forests, increased density was more often associated with decreased probability of mortality, especially during wetter periods. Results showed highest tree mortality during a drought in the beginning of our 25-year time series, but not in a subsequent drought period of similar severity. Our study also found increased risk of tree mortality on north-facing slopes across all forests and all climate periods, even when stand density was controlled for. There is a nuanced relationship between stocking level, forest mortality and drought effects, suggesting that no single density-reduction forest management strategy will increase forest resilience under all climate periods and in all forest types.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In order to quantify the effects of forests to oil palm conversion occurring in the tropics on land–atmosphere carbon, water and energy fluxes, we develop a new perennial crop sub-model CLM-Palm for simulating a palm plant functional type (PFT) within the framework of the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). CLM-Palm is tested here on oil palm only but is meant of generic interest for other palm crops (e.g., coconut). The oil palm has monopodial morphology and sequential phenology of around 40 stacked phytomers, each carrying a large leaf and a fruit bunch, forming a multilayer canopy. A sub-canopy phenological and physiological parameterization is thus introduced so that each phytomer has its own prognostic leaf growth and fruit yield capacity but with shared stem and root components. Phenology and carbon and nitrogen allocation operate on the different phytomers in parallel but at unsynchronized steps, separated by a thermal period. An important phenological phase is identified for the oil palm – the storage growth period of bud and "spear" leaves which are photosynthetically inactive before expansion. Agricultural practices such as transplanting, fertilization and leaf pruning are represented. Parameters introduced for the oil palm were calibrated and validated with field measurements of leaf area index (LAI), yield and net primary production (NPP) from Sumatra, Indonesia. In calibration with a mature oil palm plantation, the cumulative yields from 2005 to 2014 matched notably well between simulation and observation (mean percentage error = 3 \%). Simulated inter-annual dynamics of PFT-level and phytomer-level LAI were both within the range of field measurements. Validation from eight independent oil palm sites shows the ability of the model to adequately predict the average leaf growth and fruit yield across sites and sufficiently represent the significant nitrogen- and age-related site-to-site variability in NPP and yield. Results also indicate that seasonal dynamics of yield and remaining small-scale site-to-site variability of NPP are driven by processes not yet implemented in the model or reflected in the input data. The new sub-canopy structure and phenology and allocation functions in CLM-Palm allow exploring the effects of tropical land-use change, from natural ecosystems to oil palm plantations, on carbon, water and energy cycles and regional climate.},

	abstract = {Canopy shadowing mediated by topography is an important source of radiometric distortion on remote sensing images of rugged terrain. Topographic correction based on the sun–canopy–sensor (SCS) model signiﬁcantly improved over those based on the sun–terrain–sensor (STS) model for surfaces with high forest canopy cover, because the SCS model considers and preserves the geotropic nature of trees. The SCS model accounts for sub-pixel canopy shadowing effects and normalizes the sunlit canopy area within a pixel. However, it does not account for mutual shadowing between neighboring pixels. Pixel-to-pixel shadowing is especially apparent for ﬁne resolution satellite images in which individual tree crowns are resolved. This paper proposes a new topographic correction model: the sun–crown–sensor (SCnS) model based on high-resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS) and high-precision LiDAR digital elevation model. An improvement on the C-correction logic with a radiance partitioning method to address the effects of diffuse irradiance is also introduced (SCnS + C). In addition, we incorporate a weighting variable, based on pixel shadow fraction, on the direct and diffuse radiance portions to enhance the retrieval of at-sensor radiance and reﬂectance of highly shadowed tree pixels and form another variety of SCnS model (SCnS + W). Model evaluation with IKONOS test data showed that the new SCnS model outperformed the STS and SCS models in quantifying the correlation between terrain-regulated illumination factor and at-sensor radiance. Our adapted C-correction logic based on the sun–crown–sensor geometry and radiance partitioning better represented the general additive effects of diffuse radiation than C parameters derived from the STS or SCS models. The weighting factor Wt also signiﬁcantly enhanced correction results by reducing within-class standard deviation and balancing the mean pixel radiance between sunlit and shaded slopes. We analyzed these improvements with model comparison on the red and near infrared bands. The advantages of SCnS + C and SCnS + W on both bands are expected to facilitate forest classiﬁcation and change detection applications.},

This study combined the spatial advantage of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and the temporal advantage of long-term archival imagery to quantify forest mortality and to detect the subtle and chronic effects of road de-icing salts for a large mountain watershed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, USA. IKONOS-derived mortality was used in a ﬁne-scale spatial analysis to assess road proximity and roadside topography effects on forest mortality and to compare two potential mechanisms of de-icing salt damage, i.e. aerial deposition and soil uptake. These mechanisms were modeled using spatial proxy variables that were constructed from LiDAR topographical data. The analysis revealed a clear trend of increasing mortality with increasing potential for aerial deposition of de-icing salt onto tree crowns, mainly occurring within 10 m from roads. The effect of soil uptake of salt was weaker than that of aerial deposition but had a broader potential effect zone that extended to at least 100 m from roads. Landsat TM-derived mortality from 1989 to 2010 provided a long-term time series that indicated both immediate and lagged effects of salt application on forest mortality. Immediate effects of de-icing salt were only distinct in wet years when salt application and spray generation by passing trafﬁc and snow plowing were likely high and other damaging factors, such as bark beetles or drought mortality, were likely weak. A strong and consistent one-year lag in the effect of salt application on incidence of mortality suggested that longer-term impacts of de-icing salt on forest health likely involved more complex pathways than simply aerial deposition. Our multi-scale remote sensing approach provided convincing evidence that de-icing salt was a signiﬁcant factor for roadside forest mortality and allows for efﬁcient future monitoring at the large-watershed scale.},
